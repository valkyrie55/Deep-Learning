---------------------------------------Tensorflow installation --------------------------
We can't directy install tensorflow using pip install --upgrade tensorflow
I've gone through a lot of steps and finally I made through it. Here are the basic steps to follow if you are new to deep learning.

1. Install anaconda and other stuff. You don't need to install python before installing anaconda.
   Don't forget to add anaconda to your path for using it. 
   Go to command prompt and type:
          >>> where anaconda
          >>> C:\Users\digitallibrary\Anaconda3\Scripts\anaconda.exe
          >>> set path =%path%;C:\Users\digitallibrary\Anaconda3\Scripts;C:\Users\digitallibrary\Anaconda3
              #now you can use 'conda' as a command in command prompt. 
              #conda is a tool for managing and deploying applications, environments and packages.
          >>> conda  
              # this will install all the conda packages
------------------------------------------------------------
2. Create a virtual environment using conda.
   A virtual environment is a tool that helps to keep dependencies required by different projects separate by creating isolated
   python virtual environments for them. This is one of the most important tools that most of the Python developers use
   Open Anaconda prompt and type in:
     #Download it for both base and environment
          >>> conda install -c https://conda.anaconda.org/jjhelmus tensorflow
              #tensorflow is noe installed, open spyder or python console and get started.
          >>> spyder
          --------------------------------------
          #or you can create a virtualenv and then install tensorflow
          >>> conda create -n virtualenv_name
          >>> activate virtualenv_name
              #To deactivate >>> deactivate
          >>> conda install -c https://conda.anaconda.org/jjhelmus tensorflow
          >>> spyder
              #to check existing conda environments:  >>> conda info --envs
              #now import tensorflow and use, Grazie!

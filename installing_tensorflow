---------------------------------------Tensorflow installation --------------------------
We can't directyle instally tensorflow using pip install --upgrade tensorflow
I've gone through a lot of steps and finally I made through it. Here are the basic steps to follow if you are new to deep learning.

1. Install anaconda and other stuff. You don't need to install python before installing anaconda.
   Don't forget to add anaconda to your path for using it. 
   Go to command prompt and type:
          >>> where anaconda
          >>> C:\Users\digitallibrary\Anaconda3\Scripts\anaconda.exe
          >>> set path =%path%;C:\Users\digitallibrary\Anaconda3\Scripts;C:\Users\digitallibrary\Anaconda3
              #now you can use 'conda' as a command in command prompt. 
              #conda is a tool for managing and deploying applications, environments and packages.
          >>> conda  
              # this will install all the conda packages
------------------------------------------------------------
2. Create a virtual environment using conda.
   A virtual environment is a tool that helps to keep dependencies required by different projects separate by creating isolated
   python virtual environments for them. This is one of the most important tools that most of the Python developers use
   Open Anaconda prompt and type in:
          >>> conda create -n virtualenv_name
          >>> activate virtualenv_name
              #To deactivate >>> deactivate
          >>> pip install --upgrade tensorflow
          >>> spyder

  or do:
          >>> virtualenv project1
          >>> activate project1
              #to check existing conda environments:  >>> conda info --envs
          >>> conda install -c https://conda.anaconda.org/jjhelmus tensorflow
          >>> spyder
              #now import tensorflow and use, Grazie!
3. Now import tensorflow and use it.
